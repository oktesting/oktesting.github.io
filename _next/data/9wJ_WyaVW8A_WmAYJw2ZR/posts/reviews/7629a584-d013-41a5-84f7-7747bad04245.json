was hype for this one for very long time when the teaser trailer came out last year (or is it mid 2020?). closer to the releasing date, i asked a friend who was also a fan of this kinda comic book movie to see if he’s interested in seeing it and he said ok. fast forward to the opening day, i couldn’t make it to the premiere cuz i had covid. after a week i felt like the right time and i asked him again but he replied he got covid. a week later i asked him and he said he’s still recovering and told me to wait on his test. he haven’t text me since then so😐... my hype was sort of fading away till i saw the deleted scene between batman and joker (well, i didn’t technically see it, i glanced at it on the newsfeed in yt, plus i saw a lot of interview of pattinson and kravitz lately) then i my hype was pumped right up to the max man, booked the ticket a day after.","link":null},"annotations":{"bold":false,"italic":false,"strikethrough":false,"underline":false,"code":false,"color":"default"},"plain_text":"i was hype for this one for very long time when
