Nick said he is only drunk twice, and in the second time we witnessed he's fucking popping pills, cannot blame the naïve Nick entirely but he had a very great line coming from this filthy crazy montage: '...chemical madness, a willingness of the heart that burst thunderously upon us all...'. thanks to movie we get the chance to be amazed by the splendid look of the JG's mansion. From the inside, we see the interior is decorated delicately with golden art deco style arch's ceiling, wall and floor. this movie was also very stylish in term of costume from that era. Before the tour to JG's mansion we have a loveliest scene in the nick tiny house made out 'cardboard that only cost 80 a month'. i love how clumsy and nervous Gatsby was before the actual talking with Daisy, how Nick awkwardly felt out of the place between them in the room full of orchids of every kind. this Nick Carraway by Tobey Maguire hilariously reminds me of his other role of Peter Parker aka Spider-man for a bit.","href":null}]}},{"object":"block","id":"fe6d1ca0-225a-407f-9102-ba01c5d3515e","parent":{"type":"page_id","page_id":"9cc04e8c-436d-4096-9747-288d1cc07810"},"created_time":"2022-03-01T09:21:00.000Z","last_edited_time":"2022-03-01T09:21:00.000Z","created_by":{"object":"user","id":"78d4d878-a3d2-47cb-8832-99cc0d239522"},"last_edited_by":{"object":"user","id":"78d4d878-a3d2-47cb-8832-99cc0d239522"},"has_children":false,"archived":false,"in_trash":false,"type":"image","image":{"caption":[],"type":"file","file":{"url":"https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9b82e9aa-9754-4484-bb59-79b4c3c099b8/498f45d6-6a6f-423e-b26c-26e458e4813b/2021-08-29.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45HZZMZUHI%2F20240723%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240723T145536Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=b43e6f2e826f10bce450a5d3ffde679273b8915eb42cdaa92ef4faa0f5c456de&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject","expiry_time":"2024-07-23T15:55:36.192Z"}}},{"object":"block","id":"44fc1d9a-d1ee-47e9-bb77-893dd88f1e31","parent":{"type":"page_id","page_id":"9cc04e8c-436d-4096-9747-288d1cc07810"},"created_time":"2022-03-01T09:21:00.000Z","last_edited_time":"2022-03-01T09:21:00.000Z","created_by":{"object":"user","id":"78d4d878-a3d2-47cb-8832-99cc0d239522"},"last_edited_by":{"object":"user","id":"78d4d878-a3d2-47cb-8832-99cc0d239522"},"has_children":false,"archived":false,"in_trash":false,"type":"paragraph","paragraph":{"color":"default","text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"the scene that i would love to see from the book but disappoint when i don't find it in the movie or those deleted scene of the movie is the scene Nick in the car and Jordan driving and Jordan said: 'I hate careless people.
