movie i watched, i expected to get somethings out of it, like a lesson or so. however, it is a hit or miss thing and this one is truly a hit. there are not many technical detail bout this rom-com or whatever the category it belongs to. my only expectation for this one was just about some quick laugh to entertain and treated it as a mood booster, But after watching this, i was dead wrong when i assumed so. it has a very unexpected lesson bout self-esteem. when you going to an unfamiliar place, your conscious really start comparing yourself with people around, adjusting your self-esteem to fit in. that sucks, cuz most of the time my self-esteem are so low. i tend to praise people in a place that i could never live up with. and because of that assumption, we really separate our natural bonding ability, made us act differently around those unfamiliar folks compare to others that we consider as our peers. a constantly thought of doubt about yourself, of u being worthy to them and even worse you take their defects as your advantage to match with your insecurities in the relationship, that is so petty. but hey, at least i could say in this movie not the guy had that problem but the girl (even the crazy hottest one) had it too. and once those barrier is untied as they understand and accept it, nothing could stop them from the overtly cheesy movie ending.","link":null},"annotations":{"bold":false,"italic":false,"strikethrough":false,"underline":false,"code":false,"color":"default"},"plain_text":"each movie i watched, i expected to get
