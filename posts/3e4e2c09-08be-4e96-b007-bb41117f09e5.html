Alien 1979 is always my favorite whenever i think of how suspension works in thriller (alongside Psycho, duh). side note, i only discovers some of ridley scott‚Äôs works and so far so good tho. the reason that i never revisit this film for a long time was mostly because i hesitated of stepping into the universe of this Alien franchise. i watched Aliens 2 by david cameron, enjoyed but not very sure i like it or not. Never had watched Alien 3, 4 or whatever it maybe, never look a Alien vs Predator. i might like them or not but now i remain indifference toward them. however, i did watch Prometheus and Alien Covenant. Both was produced by ridley scott with the intention to clear up the event of the this original film Alien (and also with the intention of expanding even more or reviving the franchise then). after all i still in love with the original the most. what really pushed me into revisiting this was that i recently plays Alien: Isolation. a game that took place 15 years after the event of Alien (1979) and build upon it but still remaining so faithfully to the truest spirit of a horror/thriller movie with a fine touch of sci-fi to it. After finished this game and its DLC called Crew Expandable (where we could relive some of the moments from the original movie as its characters), i find it perfect timing and ready to enjoy this classic again.</span></p><div class="text-sm"><img class="mx-auto my-1" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3cfca444-d3a2-49fc-9391-30ab44eacaa0/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220304%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20220304T085613Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-Signature=be3b401f6de60c6f9bfd2c716718daa2e709579c9e61939b26d23d85fd6e942d&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;x-id=GetObject" alt=""/><span class="
