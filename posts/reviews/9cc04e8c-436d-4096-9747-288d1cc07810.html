The moment the phone rang, Gatsby rose from the water with hopefulness and happiness in his face, then the shot, the realization, the blood spreading in his chest, the acceptance in the final moment. Thanks to a comment on Youtube points out that Gatsby died in happiness knowing Daisy had chosen him over Tom but in the cruelest fact, the call is from Nick, Daisy never call then leave East Egg without bothering ever again. this scene is so brilliantly subtle with it meanings underneath. Because I rooted for Gatsby so much (and i think all of us do), i watched that scene with the lump in my throat, tears in my eyes and anger/resentment in my head. However there is nothing i can do but sit and watch his body slowly drowning in the pool. one more thing i discover is that the color of the pool is kinda emerald/turquoise like, it instantly made me thing of the green light symbol to Gatsby. for me, i would say with his death, his dream was fulfilled as he floating in the the green light (yes, im aware that im turning into somewhat a literature teacher here!).</span></p><p class="my-1"><span class="
