However right when i was disappointed bout this situation i found it on a very random unknown sketchy site. the problem is that version is raw with no sub. i utilize the built-in finding sub function of VLC and managed to find one, but that Eng sub sucked so bad. an idea struck my mind that i decide to do the Vie Sub myself based on the already perfect synchronized but inaccurate EngSub. i did the Vie Sub in one afternoon and night in my dormitory&#x27;s room. my roommates even asked me if i was coding in the afternoon Sunday when they see me doing that. the process of making it was really fun when i was actively listening and watching scene by scene over and over again. that when i discover many things i missed before and understand the hidden meanings. the Vie sub was finished and i felt really proud of one of my very first accomplishment as a side project.</span></p><p class="my-1"><span class="
