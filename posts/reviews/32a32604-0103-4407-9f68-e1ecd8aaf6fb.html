          ">is the reason why Nate betrayed Ted wasn&#x27;t explained or portrayed enough? (short answer YES, but hear me out) as nate said, ted made him a most important person in the world and deserved all attention but only attention Nate need was from ted. the missing portrayal of when nate doesn&#x27;t get what he want or ted abandons nate was not actually missing at all because THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SHOW. allow me to explain, the dynamic between these two is completely off since the first ss, and the distance between them are further than ever even tho they work in the same office and talk to each other almost everyday. the producer instead of wasting time dig deeper into this silent conflict, they neglect showing directly to your face as well as ted neglecting nate. u should figure it out yourself with your sensitivity (or being in this kinda relationship yourself to experience). in my opinion, this is brilliant from the producer because let&#x27;s be real, there are shit ton of aspects and problem to cover in a football club and the ultimate goal is to have good result. your personal matters are not matter to be prioritized even tho it&#x27;s so so harsh for anyone to endure.</span></p><p class="my-1"><span class="font-semibold

          ">btw, there are few reviews bout the so being preachy and should had stayed as comedy. first, funny witty humor only works once, twice or a few more times before people getting tired of it in a long running show. using humor in the right time and the right place as the foundation to explore more deeper into many other subjects is fucking brilliant. and the part of the show being preachy, when i don&#x27;t want to be lectured, i don&#x27;t listen to it. The soundest decision i will make when i am being preached by a TV show is i turn it off. if u want purely comedy, just watch the Ted Lasso sketches back in the days. they are so hilarious but watching them over and over again will make me sick. ted lasso series made a very long way from the gigs and i like it.</span></p></div><div class="text-right mt-5">Created at: <!-- -->04:18 02/03/2022<!-- --> | Last edited:<!-- --> <!-- -->04:41 02/03/2022</div></div></div><div class="
