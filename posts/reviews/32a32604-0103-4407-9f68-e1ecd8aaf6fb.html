          ">btw, there are few reviews bout the so being preachy and should had stayed as comedy. first, funny witty humor only works once, twice or a few more times before people getting tired of it in a long running show. using humor in the right time and the right place as the foundation to explore more deeper into many other subjects is fucking brilliant. and the part of the show being preachy, when i don&#x27;t want to be lectured, i don&#x27;t listen to it. The soundest decision i will make when i am being preached by a TV show is i turn it off. if u want purely comedy, just watch the Ted Lasso sketches back in the days. they are so hilarious but watching them over and over again will make me sick. ted lasso series made a very long way from the gigs and i like it.</span></p></div><div class="text-right mt-5">Created at: <!-- -->04:18 02/03/2022<!-- --> | Last edited:<!-- --> <!-- -->04:41 02/03/2022</div></div></div><div class="
